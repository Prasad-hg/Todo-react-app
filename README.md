## 📦 Installation & Run

Clone the repo and install dependencies:


git clone https://github.com/Prasad-hg/Todo-react-app.git
cd Todo-react-app
npm install
npm run dev   # or use: npm start if you're using CRA

🧪 How It Works

Uses useState for managing todo list and input
Each todo is an object: { id, task, isDone }
Tasks are displayed using .map()
Buttons call functions like markAsDone(), deleteTodo(), and markAllDone()
CSS handles mobile responsiveness via @media queries and flex-wrap

✨ Future Enhancements (Ideas)

⏳ Add due dates to tasks
📝 Edit task text inline
🔔 Notifications/reminders
🔒 Store tasks using localStorage or Firebase
🌗 Add dark mode toggle
